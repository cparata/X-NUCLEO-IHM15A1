# X-NUCLEO-IHM15A1

The X-NUCLEO-IHM15A1 is a dual brush DC motor driver expansion board based on the
STSPIN840 for STM32 Nucleo. It provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution for the 
implementation of compact motor driving applications such as thermal printers, robotics and toys.
Thanks to the parallel operation, it can be easily converted to a single brush DC driver 
with double current capability. The current limiters and complete set of protection features 
make it suitable for rugged applications. The X-NUCLEO-IHM15A1 is compatible with the 
Arduino UNO R3 connector and most STM32 Nucleo boards.

## Examples

There is 1 example with the X-NUCLEO-IHM15A1 library.
* X_NUCLEO_IHM15A1_HelloWorld: This application provides a simple example of usage of the X-NUCLEO-IHM15A1 
Dual Brush DC Motor Driver Expansion Board. It shows how to use two brush DC motors connected to the board,
moving the rotors with several speed values, direction of rotations, etc.
